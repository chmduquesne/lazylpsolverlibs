.Sh NAME
.Nm lazylpsolverlibs-config
.Nd Helper program to configure lazylpsolverlibs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lazylpsolverlibs-config
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program attempts to solve linear programs with different solvers, and
reports which solver libraries could be detected and used. The solver
library lookup can be influenced by setting an environment variable (see
ENVIRONMENT), or via a symbolic link (see FILES).
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables are used.
.Bl -tag -width ".." -compact
.Pp
.It Cm LAZLPSOLVERLIBS_CPLEX_LIB
Interpreted as the full path to the cplex library.
.Pp
.It Cm LAZYLPSOLVERLIBS_GLPK_LIB
Interpreted as the full path to the glpk library.
.Pp
.It Cm LAZYLPSOLVERLIBS_GUROBI_LIB
Interpreted as the full path to the gurobi library.
.Pp
.It Cm LAZYLPSOLVERLIBS_XPRS_LIB
Interpreted as the full path to the xpress library.
.Pp
.It Cm LAZLPSOLVERLIBS_DEBUG
If non empty, enables debug output on stdout.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ".." -compact
.Pp
.It Cm /usr/local/lib/libcplex.so
This file is always checked first as a candidate for the cplex library. It
takes precedence over the variable LAZLPSOLVERLIBS_CPLEX_LIB. You should
symlink this file to the actual solver library.
.Pp
.It Cm /usr/local/lib/libglpk.so
This file is always checked first as a candidate for the glpk library. It
takes precedence over the variable LAZLPSOLVERLIBS_GLPK_LIB. You should
symlink this file to the actual solver library.
.Pp
.It Cm /usr/local/lib/libgurobi.so
This file is always checked first as a candidate for the gurobi library.
It takes precedence over the variable LAZLPSOLVERLIBS_GUROBI_LIB. You
should symlink this file to the actual solver library.
.Pp
.It Cm /usr/local/lib/libxprs.so
This file is always checked first as a candidate for the xpress library.
It takes precedence over the variable LAZLPSOLVERLIBS_XPRS_LIB. You should
symlink this file to the actual solver library.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The exit status is always 0.

.Sh BUGS
No known bugs.
.Sh WARNING
The lazylpsolverlibs libraries allow loading arbitrary libraries through
environment variables, possibly introducing a security threat for your
system if used in programs that SETUID root. If you want to prevent this,
please do point @libdir@/libxxx.so (where xxx is your solver) to a
valid system library (any library will do). Whenever a library is loaded
from that path, the check for environment variables is skipped.
