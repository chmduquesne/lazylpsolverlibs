Dependencies:
============
- libltdl (distributed with gnu-libtool)
- the header of each solvers you want support for.

Important note:
==============
For your convenience, an archive named solver_headers.tar.gz is available:
https://lazylpsolverlibs.googlecode.com/files/solver_headers.tar.gz

It only contains the headers, _not the solvers binary themselves_, so the
copyright owners should not be harmed by this. Please note that this
archive is not part of the project and should not be distributed with the
source code.

If you are a copyright owner and you are uncomfortable with this archive,
please be aware that this is the same for me.  Please contact me
<chm.duquesne@gmail.com>, so that we find a solution that better suits you
(for example downloading your header directly from your site).

Building and installing:
=======================

If you want to make sure you compile your version with support for every
solvers, follow these steps:

    make download
    make
    sudo make install # or "make install" as root
