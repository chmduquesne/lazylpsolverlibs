Dependencies:
============
- libltdl (distributed with gnu-libtool)

Optional dependencies:
- the header of each solvers you want support for.

Important note:
==============
For your convenience, an archive named solver_headers.tar.gz is available:
https://lazylpsolverlibs.googlecode.com/files/solver_headers.tar.gz

It only contains the headers, _not the solvers binary themselves_, so the
copyright owners should not be harmed by this. Please note that this
archive is not part of the project and should not be distributed with the
source code.

If you are a copyright owner and you are uncomfortable with this archive,
please contact me <chm.duquesne@gmail.com>, so that we find a solution
that better suits you.
